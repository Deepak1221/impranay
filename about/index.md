Hello. My name is Pranay. I'm an Indian maker living in Delhi with a passion for arts and technology. I'm an avid webspace surfer & love reading, talking & ranting about things that affects our ecosystem and society (globally locally) and while doing so in a day to day life, I'm successfully disguised as a computer grad student & developer.
