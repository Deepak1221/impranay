> Questions by *Lady in the panel*.

*Can you share any of the moment where you felt most low in the life*<br>
Not as if this was asked first time but they don't want a real answer, and all I could do was just to bring someone in place of me. This guy always has taken good care of me, man of priorities. Always had my back no matter what life throwed on me, this guy always backed me ***Yeah just like anyone in this room I have also faced some scenarios where I might felt like giving up, like the time I was declared unfit of navy. That was the time I felt bad, but I backed up myself and fight it over*** and it was pretty convincing thanks bud.

Leaving the BBC office all I could think of that question, and her face, the tone, and gasp that I felt. And suddenly I realised that I have reached metro. Timefiles, phew I thought walking down the stairs without any motive just straying. I don't know other people but underground metro's are somewhat taunting, the guy who looks right outside from the windows all darkened. 

This guy always taunts, never talks just stares, he knows what happened we don't talk anymore now. He's not that happy kid he was before, I have lost this person long back in pursuit of someone who was just a figment of my imagination.
Sometimes I think maybe there aren't any lights down here, that's why he can't keep himself sauve. All I return to him is "hang in we will be there."<br>

>Closure is done but with lie this time.
