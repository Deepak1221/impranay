> Questions by *Lady in the Middle*.

*Can you share any of the moment where you felt most low in the life*<br>
**Back in my mind** Stream of emotions rushed into and all I could do was just to bring someone in place of me. Now this guy always has taken good care of me, man of priorities. Always had my back no matter what life throwed on me, this guy always always backed me. **Yeah just like anyone in this room I have also faced some scenarios where I might felt like giving up, like the time I was declared unfit of navy. That was the time I felt bad, but I backed up myself and fight it over** and it was pretty convincing thanks again my old bud. 

Leaving the office all I could think of that question, and her face, the tone, and gasp that I felt. And suddenly I realised that I have reached metro. Timefiles, phew I thought walking down the stairs without any motive just straying. I don't know other people but underground metro's are somewhat taunting, the guy who looks right outside from the windows all darkened. 

This guy always taunts, never stops asking question, where are we moving ahead, will you gonna do anything about this.
